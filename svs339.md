## Accelerate serverless deployments using Terraform with proven patterns
This repo contains QR codes and links used in the AWS re:Invent 2024 SVS339 session. 
## Description of the session
Event-driven architecture (EDA) enables organizations to build highly flexible and resilient systems, and customers are leveraging serverless containers to run EDA workloads due to its ease of use, scalability, and deep integrations with AWS serverless services. This session explores practical aspects of implementing EDA on Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate, focusing on patterns for consuming events in containerized environments using AWS Step Functions, Amazon SQS, and Amazon EventBridge. Learn how to build scalable, fault-tolerant, and event-driven solutions that can adapt to changing business requirements.
